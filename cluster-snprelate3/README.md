# cluster population

merge populations (90K, HQ_EC, 2019_hapmap) with PHG470 then cluster results to show differences in populations

first look at the 13 accessions from Katie (HQ_EC). These are closely related to PHG470. The first imagage is PCA. The second image is IBS cmsscale

next look at 2019_hapmap accessions. There are 200 accession accessions that are the same between 2019_hapmap and PHG470. The PCA clustering show differences in PCA3 and PCA4. The cmdscale(ibs) also shows accessions different then in PHG470. It appears that some of the accessions in 2019_hapmap are more genetically different then the PHG470 population
