<h2>Accuracy checks for imputation</h2>
<li> for imputed accessions that were used in creating the PHG, compare the imputed genotypes to the genotypes from those used to create the PHG
<li> for imputed accessions not contained in the PHG, compare the imputed genotypes to the genotypes in the 2019_hapmap protocol
