Visuzlization of PHG

1. JBrowse

https://files.triticeaetoolbox.org/jbrowse/?data=phg

JBrowse shows reference sequence and gene annotation tracks. It can also display the SNPs from the accessions used to create the PHG "SNPs from PHG472". The PHG can generate a VCF file of the haplotypes for a specified method and path. An example of this is show in the "Haplotypes from 90K" track. This tracks show the haplotypes for 100 accessions that are in both 90K and PHG472. The size and format of this file will cause JBrowse memory crash so I have shown a truncated version of this file.
